  Greeting: Helloooo!
  Conversation:
  - Dialogue: 'I''ve heard rumors that the Scholars'' Sanctum is researching a new
      essence... '
  - Dialogue: something beyond the five elementals. Imagine having a ByteBeast with
      such unique power!
  - Dialogue: Want some advice? In the Grand Arena, it's not just about the ByteBeast's
      strength...
  - Dialogue: but the connection you have with it. If you achieve that, you can win
      any battle...
  - Dialogue: Margareth and Yuliana say that shadow crystals can corrupt a ByteBeast..
  - Dialogue: but I think those are just superstitions. A good Tamer can handle it,
      right?
